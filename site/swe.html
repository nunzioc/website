<h2>Google's SWE book</h2>

Google has put out a book of their software engineering practices online.
Here are some of my notes on it.
<p>
For software to be sustainable it must be able to change.
The most common change is upgrading dependencies.
Hyrum's Law: Any observable behaviour will be depended on.
So even "backward's compatible changes" can cause breakage.
You cannot avoid change though so embrace it.
Have teams that change dependencies be the ones who upgrade other people's code.
Any infrastructure change that does not trigger a CI test failure is valid.
If it causes real world breakage, then there should have been a test covering it.
The more you do change infrastructure, the easier it becomes.
